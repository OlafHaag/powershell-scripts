Brwose to the folder to where you downloaded the CreateWindowsShutdownTiles.ps1 file and paste following command into the adress bar of the windows explorer:
`cmd /C powershell "".\CreateWindowsTile.ps1""`

To create the tiles it needs administrative rights, so choose yes if you're asked. That's it.

Should work in Windows8 & Windows10
